## 3.1.0

-   **NEW**: Update styling for `markdown` parser and add dark mode for it. UML diagrams do not currently respond to the  
    mode, but everything else will.
-   **NEW**: Added new `github_dynamic` CSS for code highlighting in light and dark mode with the `markdown` parser. It  
    is the new default.
-   **NEW**: Updated the embeded fonts in `markdown`. This caused the default `permalink` setting to be updated to  
    `\ue806`.
-   **FIX**:  Update header link insertion and styling to work with latest GitHub Markdown format returned via their  
    API.
