# Changes

## 2.0.0

Please read documentation as there have been big changes in this version which may require updates to your personal settings.

* Do not vendor Python Markdown. Python Markdown will be acquired via the current markdown dependency.

* Python Markdown configuration changes:

    * No more defining settings as `extension(option1=a,option2=b)`. Options will be defined as a dictionary.
    * You will have to define the full extension name: `markdown.extensions.codehilite`. This will allow you to import any extension you want outside of Markdown Preview.
    * New line to `<br>` conversion has been dropped from GitHub emulation as GitHub no longer does this. Ref issue #374.

* Originally a couple pymdownx-extension extensions were ported over to this plugin to give a GitHub-ish feel to Markdown, these are no longer be included directly, but are included as a dependency. This will provide the latest versions, and also provide new extensions previously not included. Ref issue #378.

* Drop ST2 so we no longer have to provide specially crafted Python Markdown versions when we try to upgrade.

* Improve yaml front matter parsing: see issue #392.

* Better UML JavaScript injection.

* Link contributors in readme.

* Remove "magic" Pygments configuration. User will now explicitly configure Pygments CSS injection separately.

* Require explicit parser name moving forward instead of default, but provide a deprecation path for the short term.

* Fix GitHub header ID generation. GitHub only lowercases ASCII chars.

* Ensure default parser is Python Markdown, and enable auto-reload by default.

* Hopefully better documentation.

* Make flake8 compatible.

* Fix outdated links.

* Remove MathJax and UML option in favor of a more generalized solution via the pre-existing `css` option.

* Remove `embed_css_for_sublime_output` option in favor of more generalized `include_head` option.

## 1.4.3

* Fix issue where Chrome prevents live reload.

## 1.4.0

* `css` setting can now be an array and contain multiple CSS files (see settings file for more info).
* Updated GitHub style to latest.

## 1.3.0

* Now supports any markdown parser through a generalized method.  Now you can map a binary to parser name via `markdown_binary_map`.  Then use the parser name in `enabled_parsers` to use it.
* MultiMarkdown specific settings have been removed.  MultiMarkdown should now be configured via `markdown_binary_map` and `enabled_parsers`.
* Upgraded to Python Markdown 2.6.4.
* Removed internal PyYaml and Pygments.  Markdown Preview now uses Package Control dependencies to obtain PyYaml and Pygments.
* Update kbd CSS for GitHub.
