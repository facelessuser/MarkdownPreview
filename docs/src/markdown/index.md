# Overview

Preview and build your markdown files quickly in your web browser.

You can use the builtin [Python Markdown][pymd] parser (offline) or use the [GitHub Markdown API][gfm-api] (online) or [GitLab Markdown API][glfm-api] (online) for the conversion.

!!! note
    If you choose the GitHub or GitLab API for conversion (set `parser` to `github` or `gitlab` in your settings), your code will be sent through HTTPS to GitHub or GitLab for live conversion. In case of GitHub, You'll have [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm-help], syntax highlighting and EMOJI support for free :heart: :gift:. If you make more than 60 calls a day, be sure to set your GitHub API key in the settings :smile:.
